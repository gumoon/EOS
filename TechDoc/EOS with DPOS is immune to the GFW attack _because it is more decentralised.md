Rumours are continuing to circulate that China is going to regulate all crypto. The rumours include closing down mining and chopping off Bitcoin itself in the great fire wall (GFW) that controls the in/out pipes for the Internet. However, one letter circulated that claims all this appears to be a fake, but it's scared many nonetheless.

中国将对所有加密货币进行管制的谣言,正在持续流传。这些传言包括关闭矿场，并通过“长城防火”(GFW)屏蔽比特币，该防火墙控制着互联网的进出通道。尽管有一封信声称这一切都是假的，然而这却让很多人感到害怕。

Can they shut down the mining? Probably, and to much larger extent than the other governments. The reasons are twofold - censorship is a normal part of life there, and the regulations are much stricter, so (1) censorship works. If you couple this to the fact that the mining companies are big and consume a lot of resource, then we can see them as obvious - (2) big hash factories are hard to hide. Therefore, it is fairly likely that an instruction to cease & desist will be taken seriously. And voluntarily. And there won't be any mucking around with secret nets or pigeon IP or ham radio.

他们能关闭矿场吗？可能，而且在很大程度上比其他政府更为彻底。原因有二，——是中国的审查制度是生活中正常的一部分，监管要严格得多，所以审查能起到效果。如果你把这与挖矿公司规模庞大、消耗大量能量的事实结合在一起，那就可以显而易见的看清这一点。(2)大的哈希工厂是很难隐藏。因此，中国很有可能会，严厉地执行停止矿场的命令。而且也不会有任何的操作空间，通过地下的网络、鸽子IP或业余无线电。

So, the potential attack on Bitcoin and Ethereum is plausible, notwithstanding the likely fake news status of it right now. The ramifications are that about 80% of the mining hashpower would be sliced off, as well as Bitcoin use being isolated within the country. One could even see a potential for Bitcoin to fork into in-country and ex-country chains, something that would align with PRC interests but maybe not with anyone else.

因此，对比特币和以太坊的潜在攻击是可能的，尽管现在可能是假新闻。其后果是，大约80%的哈希算力将被切断，同时中国国内的比特币使用也将被孤立。人们甚至可以看到，比特币有可能分裂国内和国外的两条链，这与中国当局的利益相一致，但与与其他人的利益不一致。

Curiously, and arguably intentionally, DPOS is more or less immune to this attack. The reasons are simply that (a) DPOS is far more decentralised than mining and (b) DPOS responds to the shock of country regulation quickly and without losing any efficacy.

说来奇怪，DPOS或多或少地对这种攻击免疫。原因很简单，(a) DPOS远比POW挖矿更分散，(b) DPOS能对国家监管的冲击做出快速反应。

Mining is more centralised because the forces of centralisation (or economies of scale) on it are much stronger: Bitcoin and Ethereum mining need huge amounts of electricity. As outlined in an old paper (Güring & Grigg 2011), hashing goes to where the electricity is cheapest. Which currently is in places like Inner Mongolia for various reasons that aren't going away. Further, it's not enough to have a few boxes and great net, you have to be a big warehouse. Which means we know where they all are, and they can't move, easily. Lots of electricity, lots of boxes, lots of money, lots of workers: These are highly centralised installations.

POW挖矿更加中心化,因为它的集中化(或规模经济)的力量更强；比特币和以太挖矿需要大量的电力。正如一篇论文(Guring & Grigg 2011)所概述的那样，哈希去了电力最便宜的地方。目前去了内蒙古等地。此外，仅仅拥有几个盒子和大的网络是不够的，你必须是一个大机房。这意味着，我们知道它们都在哪里，而且它们不能随意移动。很多的电力、盒子、钱、工人，所有这些都是高度集中的。

In contrast, the resources used in DPOS are much lighter. They aren't as subject to local circumstances, and are much more easily moved. Basically, each block producer needs a few big boxes with good net. Which exists in most countries, there are even hobby/volunteer sites like Funkfueur in Vienna that would fit the bill, and many countries deliver real fast net to the home with fibre which would likely be enough for a year or two.

相反，DPOS中使用的资源要轻得多。他们不受当地环境的影响，更容易被移动。基本上，每个区块的生产者只需要几个大的盒子和良好的网络设施。像维也纳Funkfueur这样的业余爱好/志愿服务网站的运行环境，在大多数国家存在，也符合法律的要求，而且许多国家很可能在一到两年内就能光纤到户。

More, the producers can be re-appointed by the community within the space of a round - approximately a minute. So the moment a large country decides to act, the community can respond as and when it is bothered - by voting to replace the suspect nodes with others ex-country. This can be done on rumour, or we can wait until those nodes drop off, and then repair the network knowing where to repair.

更重要的是，生产者在一个周期内（大约一分钟）可以由社区重新指定。因此，当一个大国决定采取行动时，社区就会做出反应，当它受到干扰时，通过投票，用其他的国家的节点，取代不可靠的节点。这可以通过谣言来触发，或者我们可以等到那些节点掉下来，然后恢复网络。

All this with zero change to the effective block production, and the risk to that production, because there is a ready pool of waiting block producers. Whereas a successful China attack will result in an 80% drop in hashrate around the world and thus the potential for a fork.

所有这些都不用改变区块的生产，也没有对区块生产的带来风险，因为有现成的区块生产等待者。然而，成功的中国攻击将导致世界范围内的哈希率下降80%，并有可能产生一个分叉。


That’s the theory - how do the numbers stack up? If we choose 75% as a suitable indicator of effective decentralisation, we can eyeball the chart (above) and see that 8 mining pools do 75% of all hashing for Bitcoin. Ethereum (below) is even worse at 5!

这仅是理论——事实数字会如何？如果我们选择75%作为有效去中心化的合适指标，我们可以看到上面的图表(上面)，8个矿池占比特币哈希算力的75%。以太(以下)更糟糕，只有5个节点!

![hashrate-eth](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmWksHJKPCCfNR6g2UyHpaFYbFgo8f2G7h8Np92SJhWM7M/HashrateETH20170924.png)

Meanwhile, DPOS is mathematical as the blocks are distributed 1 per round across 21 producers, each round, and then shuffled. Then, 75% of 21 producers is … 16, rounded up, as it was with the others.

然而，DPOS是一个数学规则，每轮由21个生产者组成，每人轮流出块，然后进行重组。75%的21个生产,取整是16。


Hence, DPOS is far more decentralised than either Bitcoin or Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or 3 if the 75% metric is any guide. The fact that there are many thousands of nodes in a Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain isn't relevant if the chain is dominated by only a small number of pools, and those pools exist in known, accounted-for places vulnerable to a forking attack. Like China. Like 80%.

因此，DPOS比比特币或以太坊要分散得多，如果75%作为评价指标的话，DPOS的去中心化程度是比特币和以太坊的2-3倍（DPOS是16，比特币是8，以太坊是5）。一个比特币或以太坊中有成千上万个节点，其实是不准确的，因为被一小部分的矿池所控制，而这些矿池存在于已知的、确定的，容易受到攻击的地方。比如中国，80%左右。
