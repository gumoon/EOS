### About the Author:
Dr.-Ing. Fabian Schuh is an entrepreneur and fervent blockchain advocate who came in contact with crypto currencies in early 2011 and was fascinated by their autonomous nature and social and political implications. As an alumni of FAU Erlangen (Germany), where he earned his Doctorate in engineering, he decided to focus on blockchain technologies and Distributed Autonomous Companies, a concept first introduced by Daniel Larimer. He founded ChainSquad GmbH and has been technical consultant and developer for numerous projects throughout the blockchain space. Recently, he joined forces with European entrepreneurs and started Blockchain Projects BV (Netherlands) to focus on development and advocating for the advancement of blockchain technologies in Europe on a larger scale.

Historical Facts about Daniel Larimer and his Contributions to the Blockchain Industry
Daniel Larimer 的经历和对区块链领域的贡献

Given that Daniel and I have been working together for over 4 years (sometimes more closely, sometimes less) I feel it is time to publish how I personally saw the last couple years in the Blockchain industry. In particular, I would like to present Dan's history and how he greatly impacted the blockchain space from my perspective.

鉴于我跟Daniel已经共事了四年多（有时候比较经常接触，有时候比较少接触）。我觉得是时候公开地谈谈我个人对这几年区块链领域的看法。尤其是，我想介绍Daniel的过去，还有从我的角度来看他如何重大影响了区块链领域。

### BitShares 比特股
In 2014, Dan Larimer built and deployed his first blockchain platform, BitShares 1.0, a decentralized exchange. He hired a team, invented Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), and delivered the fastest and most decentralized blockchain at the time (10 second blocks) with 101 elected block producers based solely on the receipt of donations to his company Invictus Innovations Inc. Like many organizations at the time, including Ethereum, the proceeds of Invictus' donations were held in bitcoin which lost over half of its value in 2014.

在2014年，Dan Larimer创办和开发了他第一个区块链平台，比特股1.0，一个去中心化的交易所。他雇佣了一个团队，发明了委托权益共识（DPOS），做出了在当时最快和最去中心化的区块链（10秒出块），这是由101个被选举出来的区块生产者来出块，做出比特股仅仅是靠其他人给他的Invictus公司的捐款。像包括以太坊在内的许多组织，Invictus捐款得来的比特币在2014年价格跌至一半。

This was when Dan first discovered the need for sustainable funding. He tried to solve the funding issue by proposing a hardfork to increase the block rewards and letting the community pick block producers who would fund development. Many of the developers left Invictus to work directly for the blockchain in what was then the first truly decentralized developer funding system. Unfortunately, the crypto-bear market made the block rewards insufficient to sustain and retain full-time developers including Dan himself.

这是Dan第一次意识到需要可持续的资金。他试图通过发起硬分叉提高区块奖励和让社区选择那些愿意资助开发的人来采矿来解决资金问题。Invictus公司是当时第一个真正去中心化的开发者资金系统，许多开发者离开Invictus公司去直接从事区块链。不幸的是，加密货币的熊市让Dan和其他开发者无法全职从事开发。‘

In 2015, Dan along with some of the BitShares developers formed a company called Cryptonomex which received a couple of hundred thousand in private investment. This company set out to solve some of the biggest problems with BitShares 1.0 and blockchains in general, namely scalability and performance. After 6 months of development, Cryptonomex announced BitShares 2.0 based upon their new blockchain software called Graphene. Graphene boasted 100,000 transactions per second and the most advanced governance model yet. Everything about the blockchain was configurable by voting including fees, block intervals, and the number of elected block producers. On November 5th, 2015, Cryptonomex licensed Graphene to the BitShares community and the blockchain was upgraded to BitShares 2.0. Later, in 2016, Graphene was released under MIT license to the public.’

在2015年，Dan和一些比特股开发者组建了一家叫Cryptonomex的公司，接受了几十万的私人投资。这个公司着手解决比特股和区块链更大的问题，即拓展性和性能。经过六个月的开发，Cryptonomex宣布推出比特股2.0，基于他们新的区块链软件“石墨烯”。“石墨烯”可以每秒处理10万笔交易，且有着最先进的管理模式。比特股区块链上的一切都是通过投票来配置的，包括费用、区块间隔和被选举的区块生产者数量。2015年11月5号，Cryptonomex授权石墨烯到比特股社区并且将区块升级到了比特股2.0。随后，在2016年，石墨烯在MIT的证书下发布给公众。

Unfortunately, the greatly improved technology was not marketed enough to boost BitShares' price to support full-time developers and the BitShares voters were not interested in supporting any worker proposals instead preferring to let the technology stabilize. Dan has said of that time,

> I put my heart and soul into BitShares but at that time we really didn't  have the income to continue so I needed to look at other projects.
> 
>不幸的是，大大改进的技术，市场并没有推高比特股的价格来支持全职开发者，而比特股的投票者也没有兴趣支持任何开发提议，反而更喜欢维持技术稳定性。Dan在那时候是这么说的：

我全身心地投入到比特股上，但是那时候没有收入来继续工作，所以我需要寻找其他的项目。

Today BitShares is self-funded, self-sustaining, self-regulated and continues to be developed by a decentralized group of developers directly hired by the blockchain through stakeholder election. Today, the BitShares shareholders collectively control a funding pool of $290M worth of BTS.

如今，比特股自负盈亏、自我维持、自我管理，并由代币持有者选举来雇佣的一组去中心化的开发者来继续开发。如今，比特股持有者总共控制价值2.9亿美金的比特股资金池。


### STEEM
In early 2016, Dan Larimer and Ned Scott teamed up to create STEEM, a social media platform on a blockchain based upon the Graphene technology. They agreed that Ned would be appointed CEO and Dan would focus on his strength, the technology. Steemit, Inc. ("Steemit") took an initial investment of $220K and then built and delivered a functioning blockchain in just a few months. It created a working website and began mining a cryptographic token called STEEM using a new CPU-only proof-of-work mining algorithm.

在2016年初，Dan Larimer和Ned Scott组建了STEEM，一个基于石墨烯的社交媒体平台。他们协商同意Ned为CEO，而Dan专注在他的技术强项。Steemit公司获得了22万初始投资，而且在短短几个月内就交付了功能块链。他创建了一个可运行的网站，而且开始了挖取被称之为STEEM代币的加密货币，STEEM只能通过CPU的工作量证明算法来挖取。

Mining for STEEM was made available to everyone at the same time with several days' notice via a post on bitcointalk.org. As the concept was new and there were less people interested in mining STEEM at the time, Steemit mined 80% of all STEEM the first week; however, this percentage decreased materially as new miners began mining STEEM. The initial mining distribution made it possible to pay voters, posters and other users thereby bootstrapping the STEEM community during its infancy. STEEM also tackled the issue of transaction costs for new users by giving them $5 in STEEM so they could read, vote and post immediately; thus providing a means by which users could interact with the application without incurring any startup fees. As of today, except for a single transaction type, no transactions on STEEM costs any network fee. This is due to the innovative introduction of rate-limited transactions that prevents spam by limiting bandwidth instead of asking for a fee.

通过bitcointalk.org网站上发布一篇文章，第一时间通知了所有人可以开始STEEM挖矿。由于概念过于新颖，那时候只有少数的人对STEEM挖矿感兴趣，第一周的矿80%是由Steem公司挖出的，但是随着新的矿工加入挖矿由Steem自挖的比例大幅度降低。最初的采矿分配可以用来支付给点赞者、发布者和其他用户来引导早期的STEEM社区方向。STEEM还结局了交易成本的问题，通过给新用户价值5美元的STEEM币来让他们可以马上阅读、点赞和发布，从而提供给用户可以立马使用程序的方式，而不用任何的注册费用。到如今，除非特别的交易类型，在STEEM上交易不会支付任何网络费用。这是由于创新地引进了限速交易，通过限制交易的带宽而不是通过交易费用来防止刷量。

Within 6 months, Steemit held less than 50% of STEEM due to inflation paid to miners, block producers, voters and posters but has maintained a large minority stake in the cryptocurrency which has given it the ability to pay for development. Some argue that STEEM is unsustainable but today, says Dan, "Steemit is well funded and can sell its STEEM to fund development of the platform."

在六个月内，由于大量地支付给矿工、区块生产者、点赞者和发布者，Steemit公司逐渐减低持有低于50%的STEEM，但这仍然有持有相当大的加密货币份额以保证有能力支付给开发者。有些人认为STEEM不可持续，但是如今，Dan说“Steemit公司有着良好的资金情况，可以通过出售STEEM来资助平台的开发者。”

Dan Larimer has long wanted to create a general purpose smart contract blockchain with parallel processing that supports applications and provide users with no-fee services and introduces ideas like Plasma to the general public as they mature. In pursuit of this vision, Dan parted amicably with Scott and Steemit and he is no longer a Steemit shareholder.

Dan Larimer长期依赖想并行开发一个通用的智能合约区块链，可以来支持应用和提供给用户无需交易费用的服务，并在成熟的时候向公众介绍类似Plasma的概念。因为追求这种想法，Dan和Scott、Stemmit和平分手，不再是Steemit的股东。

To quell false rumours including those that Dan had abandoned STEEM and left Steemit on bad terms, on April 13, 2017, Steemit and Dan made the following joint statement:

> On March 14, 2017, Daniel Larimer resigned as Chief Technology Officer of Steemit, Inc. Steemit, Inc. and Dan wish to confirm to the Steemit  community and the public generally that they have parted on amicable terms without dispute. Steemit, Inc. and Dan each look forward to  continuing to make valuable contributions to the blockchain and  cryptocurrency communities. Steemit, Inc. wishes to thank Dan for his service, and Dan wishes the Steemit officers, employees, and community members continued success in the development of the STEEM blockchain and the Steemit social media platform.

为了平息已经放弃STEEM的谣言，2017年4月13日，Steemit和Dan做了以下联合声明：

> 2017年3月14日，Daniel Larimer辞去Steemit公司的首席技术官，Dan希望向Steemit社区和公众声明，我们之间毫无争议友好地分开。 Steemit公司和Dan都期待着继续为区块链和加密货币社区做出宝贵的贡献。 Steemit公司希望感谢Dan的服务，Dan希望Steemit的员工和社区成员继续在STEEM区块链和Steemit社交媒体平台的发展中取得成功。

### EOS
There have been a lot of statements made recently about EOS. Some talk about the technology, some talk about the company block.one that builds the software, some discuss the investment/trading opportunity. Since I am an engineer and mostly interested in technology, I can only go into details about the software and some of the architectural details. However, keep in mind that the software is not in a ready-to-use state, yet.

最近有很多关于EOS的讨论。有些谈论其技术，有些谈论关于其block.one公司建立的软件，有些谈论投资机会。作为工程师我最感兴趣的是技术，我只能在软件和架构细节做深入探讨，然而，这些软件还只是设想尚未投入实用。

### Block.one
To date, block.one, the developer of the software that runs the EOS blockchain (short EOS), a new blockchain operating system designed to support commercial-scale decentralized applications, has successfully received multiple hundred millions worth of ETH in connection with its ongoing distribution of EOS ERC-20 compatible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain which began on June 26, 2017.

迄今为止，block.one，是开发EOS区块链（简称EOS）的软件开发者，EOS是一个支持商业规模去中心化的应用的操作系统，从2017年6月27号开始，已经成功获得价值数亿美金的ETH，通过不间断地在以太坊链上发行EOS的ERC-20代币来募资。

What's behind their success?

For one, the block.one team seems to have a highly experienced management team and is supported by some high profile investors and advisors from both the blockchain and financial industries. One of its more notable members is blockchain veteran Daniel Larimer, CTO, and the founder of BitShares and Steem.

他们成功的背后是什么？

其中一个原因是，block.one团队有着经验丰富的管理团队，和一些来自区块链和金融领域的高调投资人和顾问的支持。尤其是有着区块链丰富经验的Daniel Larimer，他是比特股和Steem的创始人和CTO。

### Software
EOS will be Larimer's 4th public blockchain platform in 4 years and I personally have no doubt that Dan will deliver. Those that want to find out more about the software itself, can find all the current code on github.

### EOS 软件
EOS 将是BM（Dan Larimer 的另一个外号 Byte Master,以下简称Dan 为 BM）四年当中的第四个公开区块链平台，就我而言我毫无质疑的相信他能做出成品。如果你对EOS软件本身的代码有更多的兴趣，可以去github上进行查看。

### Is there a sound technical approach to EOS.IO?
Larimer and block.one are now developing new blockchain software they call EOS.IO. In a presentation at Consensus 2017, block.one made several bold claims about the projected capabilities of their software, among these claims are:

1. Horizontal scalability through parallel processing
2. No Transaction Fees
3. Decentralized Governance
Some are questioning whether the proposed software can actually work but Dan has already created blockchains establishing, to a large extent, these goals.

### 如何全面的从技术层面理解EOS.IO ？
BM和Block.one正在开发名为EOS.IO的全新区块链操作系统，在2017年的计算机学术会议上，Block.one对EOS的目标性能做出了如下几个自信论断：

1.能够处理大规模并发交易
2.没有交易费用
3.去中心化自治
有些人质疑这样的软件是否能够成功运行，但BM已经用之前的成果来证明EOS能够有很大的可能达成甚至超越这些目标。

Ian Grigg, a well-respected financial cryptographer and the inventor of Ricardian contracts and co-inventor of triple entry accounting who is an advisor and partner of block.one says,

> At the moment, there are not many real use cases on the blockchain. BitShares
> is a successful business on a blockchain. Steem is the first successful
> distributed application for end-users – it's on the blockchain but it does not
> feel like you are on the blockchain. The users just don't need to know or care.
> Steem opens up the entire field of social media as potential DApps. What Steem
> says is that you can do anything like a social media network on a blockchain -
> you can do Facebook, you can do Twitter. What Steem says is that we now have
> validated use cases in crypto – that's extraordinary.

Ian Grigg，Block.one的一位顾问和合作伙伴，同时也是一位备受敬重的金融密码学家和Ricardian合约的发明者、三式记账法的共同开发者，这样说道：

>时至今日，区块链上的实际应用还非常少，Bitshares作为一个非常成功的区块链应用算是其中之一，Steem也同样是第一个为终端客户打造的分布式应用。 它们都搭建在区块链上，但用户基本没有感觉到他们有使用区块链，实际上用户也没有必要知道和在意区块链有什么作用。Steem打开了社交领域发展去中心化应用的大门，并且Steem的口号是你在Facebook ，twitter上做的事情，也可以在区块链上完成。它告诉我们现在数字货币技术在生活中有了很实际的应用，这是一件非常了不起的事情。



block.one promised to be fully transparent about EOS it is developing. Since June 1, 2017 (well before the beginning of the EOS token distribution), the code has been available on Github for public audit and review. Dan also continues to publish regular updates on the development of the software which are posted on STEEM (cite: https://steemit.com/trending/eos), as well as through other social media channels. block.one also promised to release EOS under open source license at the end of its development stage.

Public review of and comment on the EOS.IO Technical White Paper has also been available on github since June 7, 2017 (cite: https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).

Block.one承诺在EOS开发中保持进度透明，从2017年1月1号开始（EOS众筹开始之前），EOS的代码已经在Github上提供公开审查和浏览。BM同样也在steem和其他一些社交平台上更新EOS的开发进程（链接：https://steemit.com/trending/eos）。 Block.one也承诺EOS开发接近尾声时会对其进行合规开源。

Dan told me,

> EOS.IO plans to scale by running every contract (application) in its own thread
> with private data. Applications will communicate with each other via
> asynchronous communication. This is a well-known design pattern that shares
> certain philosophies with the sharding approach proposed for Ethereum. EOS.IO
> simply places every application within its own shard.
To me, as an engineer, this is a sound approach.

EOS utilize WebAssembly which will enable developers to use a number of different languages to write their applications, including C, C++, and Rust. Dan says early benchmarks show simple currency contracts written in C++ and run on WebAssembly are achieving 80,000 transfers per second in comparison to similar tests run on Solidity which achieve around 5,000 transfers per second.


BM告诉我：

> EOS.IO计划通过每一个合约（应用）在程序中独立的运行数据来扩大规模，应用与应用之间虽然存在不同步的数据信息，但仍然可以进行相互交流。这个设计与以太坊在试图解决分区自治问题上的哲学思路类似，不同的是EOS.IO将应用间的交流统一到了自己的分区之下。 我作为一名计算机工程师，认为这个设计是一巨大的进步。

EOS利用了WebAssembly程序，使得开发者可以使用包括C+,C++,RUST等不同的语言在其上进行程序的开发。BM说早期的测试显示，用C++语言编写的简单货币转账合约在WebAssembly上能够达到每秒运行80000笔交易，而相同的测试在Solidity上只达到每秒5000笔交易。

The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) also recently published a vision paper (citation: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/Enterprise-Ethereum-Vision). It is currently looking for alternatives to proof of work to improve scalability and reduce computational costs. There are many approaches being evaluated by the EEA which may form the future of Ethereum block consensus protocols, including Dan's Delegated Proof of Stake.

Dan states EOS being developed is simply building on an existing platform and patterns that he has already created and made his previous blockchains a success.

以太坊企业联盟（EEA）最近也展示了一份愿景图（链接：https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/Enterprise-Ethereum-Vision）， 试图寻找到提升POW（工作证明）模式可扩展性和减少计算消耗的可行方法。EEA评测过很多途径来构建以太坊未来的共识协议，而BM的股份授权证明机制（DPOS）也包括其中。BM则指出EOS一开始就开发在自己已经建立并且成功运营的区块链模式和平台之上。

### What about Decentralization?
An unproven critique of Dan's projects is that they are not decentralized; however, both BitShares and Steem are entirely operated without any central authority or servers. Every transaction on Steem is confirmed by 15 of 21 unique individuals within 45 seconds (on BitShares: ⅔ of N individuals) which Dan says is more than the 4 of 6 unique mining pools with confirmation within 6 hours that other platforms use. Dan claims that Bitcoin and Ethereum operate under a system of Delegated Proof of Work whereby miners elect a small number of mining pools to produce blocks. Arguable, the mining pools of Bitcoin look much better today, but a few years ago, we could see one or two pools owning a significant majority of the hashing power. Still, DPOS, to me is the superior technology. Also, because it removes the burden of randomness and variance that so many block producers are fighting with.

### 去中心化怎么办？
一项针对BM未经证实的批评是他的项目都不是去中心化的；然而，Bitshares和Steem都是在完全没有中心指挥和服务器的情况下运行的。在Steem上的每笔交易经过15到21个独立节点确认后在45秒内完成（Bitshares经过N个节点的⅔确认），BM说这比其他平台使用的⅔特定矿池在六个小时之内完成确认更加去中心化。他也称比特币和以太坊实际也是在DPOS的系统下选取少数一部分矿池来生出区块。但值得争议的是，时至今日比特币的矿池已经改善了很多，几年前我们看到的是一两个矿池掌管了全网绝大多数的哈希算力。
抛开这些，我认为DPOS是一个了不起的技术发明，它也解除了许许多多旷工面临的出块随机性和不确定性的压力。

Pursuant to EOS, block producers are elected by token holders but unlike other platforms, the EOS' governance model enables users to hold block producers in check if they produce empty blocks or otherwise act in ways that harm the network. The incentives of the block producers are aligned with the incentives of the users, unlike other proof of work platforms where those in control of the network are different than those who hold the tokens.

依据EOS的方式，区块生产者由代币持有者选举产生，但与其他一些平台不同的是，EOS的宪法规定EOS网络使用者有权监督区块生产者是否有生产空白区块等造假行为。这样的网络中区块生产者的利益与网络使用者的利益就是保持一致的，不像其他一些POS（权益证明）平台掌管网络算力的人与代币持有者之间有着不同的利益诉求。

According to Dan, EOS is designed to be run in dozens of datacenters around the globe which opens up far more opportunities for decentralization at scale. This may place a barrier to entry to those who want to be paid as block producers, but ultimately there are far more viable datacenters than there are viable mining data centers. Mining profitability is very sensitive to electricity rates and ultimately also requires large data centers to scale transaction volume.

根据BM的说法，EOS被设计在全球不同地区的数十个独立数据中心上运行，这为大规模去中心化提供了绝佳的机遇。这一机制可能阻挡了那些想通过挖矿获益的投机者，但最终全球会有更多运行中的数据处理中心，而不是更多开张挖矿的矿池。挖矿收益与电力费用等外部因素息息相关，并且最后也需要更大的数据处理中心来提升交易容量。

Well-known technologist, Craig Sellars, co-founder of both the Omni Foundation and Tether, says that

> Dan has always been ahead of his time in terms of blockchain innovation. Only a
> handful of individuals can create a blockchain from scratch, and Dan is one of
> those few. The man has a track record of delivering ground-breaking blockchain
> platforms and decentralized applications, time and time again. I am very
> interested in the new types of applications that can be built on a blockchain
> based on what Dan and the team will do with the EOS.IO-based platform.

### But, the progress ..?!
Arguable, to develop a blockchain with the goals as big as EOS', you'd probably need a couple hundred senior developers and at least 3 months of architectural planning and another 12 months for developing and testing. However, Dan Larimer is already working on the architecture for many years and has developed all the libraries and coding patterns needed for him to deliver a minimum viable product much earlier. From his latest Steem post, we can find that the high-performance network code is almost done and that there will be a public testing network available in just a few weeks.

著名的技术专家，Craig Sellars, 同时也是Omni基金和Tether的联合创始人这样说道：
>BM在区块链创新领域总是走在时代前面，只有极少数人能够把区块链技术从草稿上搬到实际应用中，而他是其中之一。BM对于开发前无古人的区块链应用和DAPP一次又一次的保持着行业纪录。我对于BM和他的团队新开发出的EOS.IO上能够跑出什么新型区块链应用非常感兴趣。

### 但是目前进程如何呢？

值得一提的是，对于开发像EOS.IO这样有着宏伟目标的区块链项目，需要至少几百号顶尖专业开发者、至少三个月的结构规划和一年的开发测试。然而，BM已经为整个构架准备了几年的时间，并且已开发出的宏界面和编码模型也让雏形产品能够提前问世。从他最近的Steem发帖，我们可以发现高性能的网络代码已经竣工，几周之内我们也将能够对整个网络进行公开测试。



### The Takeaway

EOS is being developed by a team with a proven track record of delivering industry leading blockchain software.

In a recent report, Dima Starodubcev, Fund Manager at Satoshi Fund said:

> Personally, I am glad that Dan Larimer, one of the brightest brains in the
> blockchain industry, after several quite successful experiments, moved forward
> to develop a full-fledged platform for smart contracts. We shall not only
> follow this project with great interest, but also do our best to facilitate its
> adaptation by DApp developers. Especially since it will be absolutely feasible
> because EOS, instead of using a specific virtual machine and programming
> language, is using a much more universal technology called WebAssembly that
> will probably lay the foundation for the entire web.
I personally believe that Dan has finally found another challenge that he can put his passion into and give birth to yet another amazing and ground breaking piece of technology.
For that, I would like to thank him sincerely.

-- Fabian (a.k.a. xeroc) Schuh

### 彩蛋

EOS正由一个屡创区块链软件开发纪录的顶尖团队操刀打造。

最近的一份报告中, Dima Starobcev，Satoshi基金会主席说道：

> 就我而言，我很高兴看到BM这位曾经开发过几个成功项目的行业顶尖人才，继续前进到开发一个更完备的智能合约平台中。我们不光会对项目保持高度关注，也会尽全力支持DAPP开发者们的工作。特别是当EOS决定使用WebAssembly这项更通用的技术而不是某一特定的虚拟机或编程语言时，整个项目变得更加可行，甚至有很大可能为未来整个DAPP网络打下基础。

我个人非常相信BM终于找到了一项能让他自己注入全部热情和精力的挑战，从他手中也会诞生另一个前无古人的伟大科技产品。就这一点，我想对他表示由衷的感谢。
