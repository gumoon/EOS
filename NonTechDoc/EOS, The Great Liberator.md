Jump onto any EOS chat online and the following phrases can be read:

登上任何一个EOS的在线聊天室，以下的句子随处可见：

“EOS to the MOON” -- EOS飞向月球

“EOS is the new ETHEREUM” --EOS是新一代的以太坊

“EOS is going to change the world”--EOS将要改变世界

This kind of online cheerleading is fairly typical in the cryptocurrency world; every coin has its followers, and since most followers have invested time and money into the coin they follow, every coin has its die hard fans. Convinced that their coin will be the one that “changes it all”, they take to their computers to sing the the praises of the tech, the team, and the community. They breathlessly relay the latest news, rumors, price charts, progress, and encourage each other to HODL through the highs and lows of the market. In this regard, the relatively small but dedicated EOS community is rather typical; they love the coin and often talk about its tech, its team and its ability to change the world as we know it. What sets the EOS community apart from other blockchain projects is that they might actually be right.

这种线上啦啦队，在加密货币的世界里相当常见；每一种虚拟币都有它自己的追随者和死忠粉，他们把时间和金钱投入到他们追随的币种上。他们相信他们的币将会“改变一切”，他们会带着他们的电脑去颂扬他们的技术、团队和社区。他们一刻不停地传播着最新的消息、谣言、价格图表、进展，他们相互鼓励，不管市场的涨跌，都长线持有他们的币。随市场的涨跌买入。在这方面，相对较小，但专注的EOS社区相当典型；他们热爱EOS，经常谈论它的技术，它的团队以及它改变世界的能力，正如我们所知道的那样。但是，EOS社区与其他区块链项目的区别在于，事实可能证明他们可能正确的。

### The Visionary | 愿景

EOS is the brainchild of Dan Larimer, a mature blockchain developer in the emerging market of alt-coins. While many second generation coins are the result of first-time blockchain developers, Larimer is unique in that EOS will be his third creation and most ambitious project to date. He hopes EOS will become the blockchain platform that allows the world to “decentralize everything”. He plans on doing this by creating a “software” that allows large online companies, or DAPPS to build and run on the EOS platform as smoothly and easily as they would any centralized software; this is a big task.

EOS是Dan Larimer的创意。在蓬勃发展的虚拟货币市场里，他是一个成熟的区块链开发者。虽然许多第二代币，是由没有经验第一次做区块链的开发者所开发的，但Larimer是独一无二的，EOS将是他迄今为止的第三个，并最具雄心的项目。他希望EOS将成为一个区块链基础平台，让世界“一切去中心化”。他计划通过创建一个“软件”来实现这一目标，该软件允许大型在线公司或DAPPS在EOS平台上构建和运行，像任何中心化的软件一样流畅和轻松；这是一项艰巨的任务。

While blockchain technology has had some big wins (Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two “household names”), no one blockchain has been able to “crack the code” as of yet. There are problems. The technology is relatively new, and there are kinks - bugs to be worked out. Blockchains can be slow and congested; systems can go off-line and fall victim to virtual attacks. Not only can transactions be slow, but they can be EXPENSIVE:

虽然区块链技术已经取得了一些重大的进展(比特币和以太坊已是两个“家喻户晓的名字”)，但迄今为止还没有一个区块链能够真正“破解成功之道”。他们都有一些问题。这项技术相对较新，有一些缺陷需要解决。现有的区块链可能缓慢而拥挤;系统可能掉线并成为虚拟攻击的受害者。区块链的交易过程不仅可以缓慢，而且费用昂贵:

Blockchains can be hard to build on as well - the foundational code is often hard to decipher, and very restrictive in their language requirements. What should an aspiring blockchain developer do?

区块链也很难构建，—— 基础代码通常很难理解，而且在开发语言要求也非常高。一个有抱负的区块链开发人员应该怎么办?

### Enter EOS | 进入EOS 

Larimer states that EOS will solve all these problems and more; the system will be able to process thousands of transactions a second, it will have NO fees, and it will be “out of the box” ready - in other words, all the pertinent problems currently perplexing the blockchain world would be no more. This kind of talk shouldn’t come as a shock; the volatile alt-coin market rises and falls based on hype, and these kinds of claims are common place in the crypto world, but what sets EOS apart is that Larimer has already delivered on these promises twice before. The creator of not one, but two top 50 coins on coinmarketcap.com, his creations are among the fastest performing blockchains on the market. Bitshares, his original work, is a decentralized financial platform that in many ways, was ahead of its time. With Bitshares Larimer invented DPOS, or delegated proof-of-stake, a system that makes the energy intensive, and hard to break into mining model, obsolete. His next coding project turned into Steem, the backbone of Steemit, a social media site that pays its content creators directly. While other coin communities depend on a promise and a white paper, the EOS community has Larimer.

Larimer指出，EOS将解决以上的这些问题，甚至更多；系统将能够处理每秒数千的事务，没有任何交易费用，而且“开箱即用”——换句话说，当前困扰区块链世界的这些问题将不复存在。这种谈话不让人感到震惊，暴涨暴跌的代币市场建立在炒作的基础上，这种说法在加密货币的世界中是常见的，但是EOS的不同之处在于，Larimer已经两次实现了承诺。在coinmarketcap.com网站上，他创造了两个前50的货币，他创造的链位列市场上性能最快的区块链之中。他的原创作品Bitshares是一个去中心化的金融平台，在很多方面都领先于时代。通过Bitshares， Larimer发明了DPOS，或委托权益证明，这一系统使得能源密集并且难以进入的挖矿模式，过时了。他的下一个项目是Steem，这是一个社交媒体网站，它直接付费给内容创建者。当其他的代币社区依赖于一个承诺和一张白纸时，EOS社区就有了Larimer。

### The New World Economy | 新世界经济

If Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s aim is to “bring the world closer together”, Larimer’s would be to reinvent it. A libertarian, he is not driven by accolades or riches, but rather philosophy. He envisions a new world order in which power and control lies far and wide, with community and cooperation taking center stage. When spoken about abstractly, Larimer’s ambitions may seem euphoric, pie in the sky, or unfocused, but when one begins to explore EOS and the technology behind it, realization dawns that this tool could usher in a new era in humanity, one that could change it all.

如果Facebook的马克•扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)的目标是“让世界联系更紧密”，Larimer将会重新定义它。驱动一个自由主义者的，不是荣誉和财富，而是思想哲学。他设想了一种新的世界秩序，在这种秩序中，远离权力和控制，社区和合作成为中心。当抽象地谈论时，Larimer的雄心壮志可能会显得狂热，希望渺茫，或者不专注，但是当一个人开始研究EOS以及它背后的技术时，他会逐渐意识到这个工具，可以引领人类进入一个新的时代，可以改变一切。

This is not hyperbole; this is a real possibility. The central philosophy behind EOS, and almost all cryptocurrencies, is that of decentralization. Decentralization simply means that there is no central source of command, control, or power in the organization. Larimer took this a step further and invented the concept of DAC (decentralized autonomous company). A DAC has no captain on the ship, rather it lives and dies by the passion, involvement, and ingenuity of its community. EOS holders have real power in this system; in fact, they ARE the system.

这不是夸张，是真实可能的。EOS以及几乎所有的加密货币，背后的核心理念，是去中心化。去中心化意味着，在组织中没有中心化的命令、控制或权力。Larimer更进一步，提出了DAC(去中心化自治公司)的概念。一个DAC，如同在船上没有船长，而它的生死是由它社区的激情、参与程度和创造力所决定。EOS持有者在这个系统中拥有真正的权力；事实上，他们就是系统。

EOS token holders will have a variety of responsibilities, each as important as the next. They vote for block producers (block producers are charged with securing the system and ensuring creating “blocks” or pages of the public ledger that are accessible by all in the system), they control which DAPPS can use the EOS bandwidth for their projects (each coin will represent a certain amount of bandwidth on the system), and holding EOS coins entitles them to “free” tokens given out to them as payment for certain DAPPS that end up using their system (possibly killing the ICO model that has come under heat as of late as regulators grapple with the crypto space). No other coin allots its holders as many perks, privileges or POWER as EOS; its function is truly unprecedented in the blockchain sphere.

EOS代币持有者负有各种各样的责任，每一个都和下一个一样重要。他们投票给区块生产者(区块生产者负责系统安全,确保生产区块或公共账本,并能够被系统中所有的人访问),他们决定哪个DAPPS可以使用EOS带宽(每个代币都代表一定的系统带宽),持有EOS使他们有权获得“免费”代币，作为一个DAPPS最终能使用系统的支付手段(可能消灭ICO模型，最近很热门以致监管机构尽力打击)。没有任何一种代币，能像EOS一样给它的持有者带来许多福利、特权或权力；它的功能在区块链领域，前所未有。

Zoomed in, the technology can seem quite specific and inconsequential in the greater scheme of things, but zoom out and the revolution starts to take shape. In a centralized company, much of the profits, benefits, and power concentrates in a few, strong hands. The CEO, board of directors, majority share holders, etc, reap the rewards of a working class; the many for the few. The innovation and proclamation of a DAC is quite the opposite; wealth will be spread far and wide, opportunity is plentiful, and the fate of a company relies on those in the community that have built it, so they shall reap the rewards.

光从技术看，似乎显得过于具体甚至无关紧要，但宏观来看，一场革命正在开始成形。在一个集中化的公司里，大部分利润、利益和权力，集中在少数几个强有力的人手中。首席执行官、董事会、多数股东等，收割了劳动阶级的成果；大多数人为少数人服务。DAC的创新和宣言是完全相反的；财富将会广泛传播，机会也会很多。公司的命运依赖于社区，他们将会收获回报。

What does this mean? Well, let’s do a thought experiment.

这是什么意思？让我们做一个思想实验。

Need a home-loan? No need to go to the bank, plug in to your local blockchain-run lending company and get approved; the loan is processed immediately and the money is put into your online wallet. The contract is saved on the blockchain, so the terms cannot be altered. Since overhead is minimal, so is the interest rate; in fact, the company only charges a fraction of a percent on your loan.

需要一个房屋贷款？没有必要去银行，走进你当地的区块链贷款公司，申请贷款；贷款会立即处理，钱将放入你的网上钱包。合同保存在区块链上，条款不能更改。因为开销很少，所以利率也是很少；事实上，公司只收取你贷款的一小部分费用。

Spending a great deal of time on Twitter? Do your tweets attract a good amount of traffic? What if every “retweet” you got resulted in money, and you could make your living by tweeting? It would only be natural; you provide the content that Twitter relies on, of course you should get paid.

花大量时间在Twitter上？你的Twitter吸引大量的流量？如果你的每一个“转发”都带来了收入，你可以通过推特来谋生？这是自然的；你提供Twitter所依赖的内容，当然你应该得到报酬。

Live in a country with hyper-inflation? Invest your money into a stable cryptocurrency that is secured not by a government, but by crypto-holders across the globe.

生活在一个通货膨胀过度的国家？把你的钱投资到一种稳定的加密货币上，它不是由政府担保的，而是由全球各地的加密持有者所保证的。

###  The implications are immense. | 影响是巨大的

Meritocracy would be king. Democracy and capitalism, two often-times seemingly incompatible partners would finally peacefully co-exist. Our planet’s most creative, artistic, and passionate souls could survive by their talents, without pesky middle men taking most of the profit. By cutting out centralization, EOS holders envision a world that is more efficient, accessible, and fair. With the EOS blockchain as the backbone of this redistribution of wealth, large swaths of peoples and nations can re-write their destiny; any and everything that exists online today can be reconfigured to perform on the blockchain - let that sink in for a moment.

知识精英为王。民主和资本主义，这两个经常看似不兼容的东西，最终会和平共存。我们这个星球上最具创造力、最具艺术性和激情灵魂的人，可以靠他们的才能生存，而不需要那些讨厌的中间人攫取大部分的利润。通过消除中心化，EOS持有者构想了一个更高效、更便捷、更公平的世界。随着EOS区块链作为财富再分配的支柱，很多的民众和国家可以改写他们的命运；今天线上的任何东西都可以被重新配置为在区块链上运行。

This is a game changer. The world would be more meaningfully united.

这是一个游戏规则的颠覆者。世界将更有意义地联合起来。

### The Opportunity | 机遇

This worldview is reflected in the setup of EOS and the community building efforts already taking shape around the coin itself. Several online forums have been created to discuss EOS and the best ways to get involved. EOStalk.io is dedicated to anything and everything EOS and is built upon the Steem blockchain, the aforementioned Larimer project. There you can find posters from all walks of life discussing the latest EOS news and price charts.

这一世界观已反映在，EOS及其社区的建设上，目前这种努力已经在EOS代币周围形成。几个在线论坛已创建，讨论EOS及其最佳的参与方式。EOStalk.io致力于收集所有的EOS信息，并建立在Steem上，即上面提到的Larimer项目。在那里，你可以找到来自各行各业的，讨论EOS新闻和价格图表的文章。

Another option is forums.eosgo.io for a focused approach, aiming to become the go - to resource for community members come together to plan for the presumed June 2018 launch. The forum is a one-stop networking shop full of entrepreneurs, evangelists, and idealists all working together to breathe life into the newly forming EOS ecosystem.

另一个网站是 forums.eosgo.io，以一种专注的方式，旨在成为社区成员的核心资源中心，共同筹划2018年6月的主链上线。该论坛是一个一站式的网站，汇聚了创业者、布道者和理想主义者，他们共同努力，为新形成的EOS生态系统注入活力。

On Telegram, several EOS centric chats have been created, with the main group boasting over 27k members.

在电报上，已经有几个以EOS为中心的聊天群组，主群中有超过2.7万的成员。

A small, unofficial discord channel has a dedicated crew that logs in to discuss rumors and ideas about EOS and its latest developments.

一个小的，非官方的频道，有专门的工作人员组织讨论关于EOS的谣言和想法，以及它的最新发展。

The EOS sub-reddit is full of believers and naysayers arguing over the merits of the coin and its ability to deliver on its hefty promises.

EOS 的sub-reddit，充斥着信徒和反对者的争论，他们争论EOS代币的优点，以及兑现巨大承诺的能力。

In a decentralized system, these organically forming communities are key to the success of EOS; without a centralized hub, the deployment of EOS and the technology will literally be in the EOS coin holders hands.

在一个去中心化的系统中，这些有机组成的社区是EOS成功的关键；没有一个中心化机构，EOS的部署和技术掌握在EOS持有者手中。

The EOS community does not take the responsibility lightly, and those that share Larimer’s vision are encouraging spectators to jump on the EOS bandwagon before it’s too late. Early and committed involvement are essential to the success of EOS, and there are a variety of ways to get involved. Join any EOS forum and you can participate in the creation of a launch party, or organize a local meet-up with your fellow EOS enthusiasts. DAPP (decentralized apps) teams are starting to take form over in the EOS opportunities Telegram, and potential block producers are beginning to test the waters over at EOStalk.io, but it’s not too late.

EOS社区并没有对这一责任掉以轻心，而那些分享Larimer愿景的人，也在鼓励旁观者加入到EOS的洪流中，以免为时过晚。早期的参与，对于EOS的成功至关重要，并且已经有各种各样的方法来参与。加入任何EOS论坛，你可以参与创建一个组织，或和EOS的爱好者组织一个本地meet-up。在EOS的电报中，DAPP(去中心化的应用程序)团队已经开始形成。潜在的区块生产者开始试水，在EOStalk.io上，但现在还不算太晚。

Since EOS is decentralized, there is no job interview, no secret club, no hand you must shake to join the movement - all you have to do is simply join. Find a niche where you feel comfortable, do some networking, make some friends, and work on projects that you enjoy. No where else is the barrier to entry so low.

因为EOS是去中心化的，没有工作面试，没有秘密俱乐部，不用依赖别人就能加入这场运动——你所要做的很简单，就是加入。找一个你觉得舒服的地方，做一些社交活动，交一些朋友，做一些你喜欢的项目。没有别的地方--有这么低的进入门槛。

The message radiating from the EOS community is clear; if you want to you make your dent in the universe, NOW is the time, HERE is the place, and EOS is the conduit.

来自EOS社区的信息是非常清晰的；如果你想在这个世界留下印记，现在正是合适的时间，这里正是合适的地方，EOS正是合适的通道。
