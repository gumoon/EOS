NOTES: 
* Software releases can be found [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases "EOS.IO Releases").
* Tags (bundles of code that go together for deployment, mostly between releases) can be found [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/tags "EOS.IO Software Tags").
* Tags can never provide a document that includes themselves. Therefore the above list, when located in Readme.md, cannot include the latest tag. This same list when found in a wiki can include the latest tag.
